	This application is based on widget tree which can be expanded in any branch. Main idea was:
every widget must handle only one layer of it's childs, giving them full freedom while they are shown.

root\
	CoreWidget: This widget is root for 7 branches. It provides a frame with general utility buttons:
		    settings and shutdown. It tries to capture key events and pass them to the currently 
		    opened branch if this widget is in focus, allowing children to react.
	SettingsForm: This widget is basic settings screen associated with coreWidget. It is modifying 
		    GlobalAppSettings - a global structure which is used to provide any widget info about 
		    important data: at least there are saved url's and paths.
  \CameraBranch\
	This branch responds for camera widget specialization which can operate with camera.Check parents
	directory for AbstractCameraWidget which provides base for this branch's main widget.
  \InventoryBranch\
	This branch is based on BranchRootWidget and provides standard branch for operating with particular
	database - Inventory. Check parents\BranchRootWidget for base of this wrapper.
  \MainPage\
	This branch is used as default in CoreWidget and allows to choose which branch must be opened
  \MultibranchWidgets\
	This folder holds all widgets related to widgets which are not branch-unique. These are Scaning
	family, which is included in every branch based on BranchRoot etc. Many branches are using widgets
	from this folder, but most of them are based on BranchRoot.
  \parents\
	This folder contains parents widgets for many other widgets. One of core parents, which is inherited by most
	other widgets is inframedWidget - an abstract inheritor of QWidget which provides important interfaces 
	for one-screen applications, such as back() method which hides current widget and opens parent one. Other are 
	abstracted combo-widgets which can be inherited to provide more functions.
  \SearchBranch\
	This branch inherits AbstractScaningWidget to provide simple search interface
  \SupplyBranch\
	This branch is similar with Inventory - at least now
  \SimpleBranch\
	Is similar with Inventory
  \utils\
	This folder contains all classes which are used in widgets, but does not belong to any branch. There can be
	different elements - buttons, little widgets, styles, core storage elements.
