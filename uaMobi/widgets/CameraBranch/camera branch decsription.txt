This branch is short and concentrated on letting user use camera as normal. 
/CameraWidget/
	This widget is based on Abstract Camera Widget and is implementing make-image button with normal behaviour.
	This widget is using CameraSurface qml file for building camera surface - it is using ZXing filter without any decoders
	and without borders. ZXing filter is required because normal Viewfinder does not work with Android.
